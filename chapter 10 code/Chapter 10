4. Employee Class

Write a class named Employee that holds the following data about an employee in attributes: name, ID Number, Department,
and job title.

Once you have written the class, write a program that creates three Employee objects to hold the following data:

Name            ID Number   Department      Job Title
======================================================
Susan Meyers    47899       Accounting      Vice president
Mark Jones      39119       IT              Programmer
Joy Rogers      81774       Manufacturing   Engineering

The program should store this data in three objects, then display the data for each employee on the screen.

Thoughts:
I think I should start off by simply creating two different python programs, one will be my main function, the other
will have the meat and potatoes and be a module with the class in them.

3. Personal Information Class

Design a class that holds the following personal data: name, address, age, and phone number.
Write appropriate accessor and mutator methods. Also, write a program that creates three instances of the class.
Each instance should hold fictional information for a fake person.
(For privacy purposes, do not store real personal information in your program.)
