Welcome to my Introduction to Python Programming 110 GitHub repository page!

Each chapter has its own folder with programs I have created, as well as a text file explaining how/why I 
programmed them a certain way. I have also included a JupyterNotebook with examples of the code running!

Please feel free to check out my linkedIn page!

I will also be linking my upcoming website full of portfolio projects! Feel free to check that out once
it is posted on linkedIn.
